# OTP_Generator
A simple OTP generator which also stores OTPs.

This generator lets you choose the number of digits you want to include in your OTP.
Generated OTPs are then stored in the text file to avoid generating identical OTPs and they also provide reference like which OTP was sent at what time(UTC).
